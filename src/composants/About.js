                Hi, I'm Milo Niemaz, a sophomore informatic student in IUT2 of Grenoble 38000.
                I'm having a lot of fun learning about web development and I'm looking 
                forward to learn more about it. That's why I'm doing this business card using React.
            </p>
            
        </div>
    );
